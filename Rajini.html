    Rajinikanth worked again with Shankar for the science fiction film Enthiran.[116] The film was released worldwide in 2010 as the most expensive Indian film ever made, ultimately becoming the second highest-grossing film in India of its time.[117][118][119] Rajinikanth was paid a remuneration of ₹450 million (equivalent to ₹1.0 billion or US$13 million in 2023) for the film.[120] He received his seventeenth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for his performance in the film. The film's success lead to the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad to use the film as a case study to analyse the business of cinema and its success story in a post-graduate elective management course called Contemporary Film Industry: A Business Perspective. The course would also study Muthu.[121]
